KVM Hypercalls Documentation
===========================
Template for documentation is
The documenenation for hypercalls should inlcude
1. Hypercall name, value.
2. Architecture(s)
3. Purpose


1. KVM_HC_VAPIC_POLL_IRQ
------------------------
value: 1
Architecture: x86
Purpose:

2. KVM_HC_MMU_OP
------------------------
value: 2
Architecture: x86
Purpose: Support MMU operations such as writing to PTE,
flushing TLB, release PT.

3. KVM_HC_FEATURES
------------------------
value: 3
Architecture: PPC
Purpose:

4. KVM_HC_PPC_MAP_MAGIC_PAGE
------------------------
value: 4
Architecture: PPC
Purpose: To enable communication between the hypervisor and guest there is a
new shared page that contains parts of supervisor visible register state.
The guest can map this shared page using this hypercall.

5. KVM_HC_KICK_CPU
------------------------
value: 5
Architecture: x86
Purpose: Hypercall used to wakeup a vcpu from HLT state

Usage example : A vcpu of a paravirtualized guest that is busywaiting in guest
kernel mode for an event to occur (ex: a spinlock to become available)
can execute HLT instruction once it has busy-waited for more than a
threshold time-interval. Execution of HLT instruction would cause
the hypervisor to put the vcpu to sleep (unless yield_on_hlt=0) until occurence
of an appropriate event. Another vcpu of the same guest can wakeup the sleeping
vcpu by issuing KVM_HC_KICK_CPU hypercall, specifying APIC ID of the vcpu to be
wokenup.

TODO:
1. more information on input and output needed?
2. Add more detail to purpose of hypercalls.
